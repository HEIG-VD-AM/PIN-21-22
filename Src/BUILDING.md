# QtCreator
To build the project with qtcreator, open a project by selecting the `gui.pro` file then choose your kit (6.3.1+) and you'll be ready to work.

# CLion

Make sure to have set `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to your qt toolchains (choose the cmake version according to your clion compiler (msvc, mingw, ...)).
